As a former Emmanuel College vet, Claire Budge has a wealth of experience in
clinical and leadership roles in the British Army. Deployments to Iraq and
Afghanistan saw her treating and training military working dogs and horses, and
she has more recently moved through positions of leadership and senior
management within the army. She is a fantastic example of someone who has
explored an unconventional veterinary career path, and has interesting
perspectives on:

- where and why we have animals in the army?
- challenges of managing working dog injuries in the field?
- vet medicine in some contexts can't always be in the 1st person
- ethics of dog handling
- leadership and 'one welfare'
