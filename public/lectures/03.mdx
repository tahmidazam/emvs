Dr MacDonald-Nethercott enrolled on multiple missions to the French Polar
Institude at Concordia Station in Antarctica. He was employed primarily as a
scientist to perform experiments at the Concordia Station on behalf of the
European Space Agency, but given his background in Emergency Medicine - he often
found himself supporting the medical team with complex medical emergencies -
managing the stabilisation and evacuation of patients in one of the remotest
places on earth. His talk will cover:

- His experiences as an expedition scientist and doctor
- The Concordia Station and its environment
- Clinical cases
- Logistical challenges facing medical care in that environment
- ⁠The steps he took to have a career like this

An excellent talk for NatScis and Medics curious about expedition research
or medicine!
