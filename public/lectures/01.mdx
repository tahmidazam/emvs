Dr Gavin Wooldridge has extensive humanitarian medicine experience, working in
Lebanon, Malawi, Tanzania and most recently Gaza. He will be speaking about his
experiences working in these settings, along with his career pathway and how he
has balanced this with family life. It promises to be an interesting talk and we
would encourage anyone who is interested to come along.
